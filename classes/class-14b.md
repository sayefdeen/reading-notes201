# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team.

Even if the teams had a brilliant colleagues, you can't say it is the perfect team, some time the team it self will become a source of stress, especially if the colleagues were jockeyed for the leadership position or criticized one another’s ideas, and try to show authority by speacking louder or talking over each other.

These types of teams will never last, because the idea of teams is to work together to come with solutions for some sort of problems without criticized one another’s ideas, sometime the creziest idea is the best.

### Why Groups.

Software engineers are encouraged to work together, <span style="color:red">in part because studies show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems. Studies also show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction</span> teams are now the fundamental unit of organization. If a company wants to outstrip its competitors, it needs to influence not only how people work but also how they work together.

To make the best team you have to ask these questions.

- Were the best teams made up of people with similar interests?

- did it matter more whether everyone was motivated by the same kinds of rewards?

- How often did teammates socialize outside the office?

- Were their educational backgrounds similar?

- Was it better for all teammates to be outgoing or for all of them to be shy?

Along the studies, researchers notices two behaviors that all the goof teams generally shrard.

1. First, on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as ‘‘equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.’’ On some teams, everyone spoke during each task; on others, leadership shifted among teammates from assignment to assignment. But in each case, by the end of the day, everyone had spoken roughly the same amount.

2. the good teams all had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues.

### Unwritten rules.

1. psychological safety.

the behaviors that create psychological safety — conversational turn-taking and empathy — are part of the same unwritten rules we often turn to, as individuals, when we need to establish a bond. And those human bonds matter as much at work as anywhere else. In fact, they sometimes matter more.

2. Equal Amount of speaking.

Each team member have to get an equal portion of time to discuss their ideas, without being judged over them.

3. Respect.

All team members should and have to respect each other and their leadership, this respect will lead to having better conversation between the members and find solutions will be more easy.
